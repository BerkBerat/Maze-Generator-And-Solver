# Maze Generator and Solver

A maze generation and solving program built with Java. This project uses algorithms to generate random mazes and then solves them using different solving techniques. The maze is displayed visually, allowing users to interact with the program and view the solution.

## Features

- Random maze generation using popular algorithms (e.g., Prim’s, Kruskal’s, or Recursive Backtracking).
- Maze solving using algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), or A*.
- Visual representation of the maze and its solution.
- Interactive interface to generate new mazes and view solutions in real-time.
  
## Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Algorithms**: Maze generation (Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Recursive Backtracking), Maze solving (DFS, BFS, A*)
- **Graphics**: Java Swing / JavaFX (or another graphics library used for maze display)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BerkBerat/Maze-Generator-And-Solver.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Maze-Generator-And-Solver
    ```

3. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## How It Works

- **Maze Generation**: The program generates a random maze based on the selected algorithm (e.g., Recursive Backtracking or Prim’s).
- **Maze Solving**: The program solves the generated maze using selected algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Visualization**: The maze is rendered using Java’s graphical libraries. The solution path is highlighted, and users can see step-by-step progression through the maze.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can generate new mazes, select solving algorithms, and visualize solutions.
